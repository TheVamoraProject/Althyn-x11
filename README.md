# Vamora StatusBar (X11)

Part of [**VamoraOS**](https://github.com/TheVamoraProject/VamoraOS/)/[**Althyn**](https://github.com/TheVamoraProject/Althyn/) — a Qt6/QML + Rust ([cxx-qt](https://github.com/KDAB/cxx-qt)) status bar for VamoraOS. This component targets **X11** window managers (developed and tested on Openbox) as a pre-alpha build; a Wayland version is the long-term target.

It's built with the **AlthynUI** design language

## What this is

`vamora-statusbar-x11` is a single always-on-top, frameless Qt window rendered via QML, backed by a small Rust core using `cxx-qt`. It provides:

- A top status bar (clock, tray icons, wifi/battery/volume indicators, notification bell)
- A start menu (app grid, search, favorites, right-click context actions)
- A calendar popup
- X11 screen-reservation (EWMH struts) so maximized windows don't sit underneath the bar


---

## Features

### Status bar
- Live clock (`hh:mm  ddd, d MMM` format), updates every second
- Start menu toggle button (opens/closes the app grid popup)
- Notification bell icon (UI only, not yet wired to a notification daemon)
- Volume, wifi, and battery tray icons
  - Wifi icon dynamically swaps between 0–4 bar states based on real link quality read from `/proc/net/wireless`
  - Volume and battery icons are currently static placeholders
- Settings shortcut icon
- Mutually-exclusive popups: opening the start menu force-closes the calendar and vice versa

### Start menu
- Full app grid populated by scanning `.desktop` files from:
  - `/usr/share/applications`
  - `/usr/local/share/applications`
  - `~/.local/share/applications`
- Live search/filter box (case-insensitive substring match on app name)
- **Staggered entrance animation** — icons fade + scale in one at a time, sweeping left-to-right, top-to-bottom (row-major order), instead of all popping in simultaneously
- Maximize/restore toggle (expands the start menu to fill the screen below the status bar, changes grid column count from 5 → 8)
- Right-click context menu per app icon:
  - **Add to Homescreen** — copies the `.desktop` file to `~/Desktop/`
  - **Add to Favorite** — copies the `.desktop` file to `~/Desktop/.favorites/`
  - **App Info** — placeholder, not yet implemented
- AlthynUI always on Bottom navbar switching between:
  - All apps
  - Favorites (loaded on demand from `~/Desktop/.favorites/`)
  - History (UI present, not yet wired to real data)
- Click-outside-to-close behavior, with a guard timer so a maximize/restore toggle doesn't immediately trigger a close

### Calendar
- Popup window anchored below the status bar clock button, same open/close exclusivity as the start menu

### System integration
- **X11 EWMH strut reservation**: on startup, a background thread locates the status bar's own window via `_NET_CLIENT_LIST` + `_NET_WM_PID`, then sets `_NET_WM_STRUT` / `_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL` so X11 window managers reserve the top strip of the screen and don't let maximized windows overlap the bar. Retries for a few seconds in case the window manager hasn't registered the window yet. Wayland compositors ignore this entirely and it would stay in the middle instead of the top(X11-only, by design, for now).
- **Profile picture resolution**, checked in priority order:
  1. `/var/lib/AccountsService/icons/<user>` 
  2. `~/.face`
  3. `~/.face.icon`
  4. Falls back to the bundled `account.svg` icon if none exist
- **Wifi strength polling**, refreshed every 5 seconds alongside username/profile picture

## Dependencies

From `Cargo.toml`:

| Crate | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `cxx` | 1.0.197 | Underlying C++ interop used by cxx-qt |
| `cxx-qt` | 0.9.1 | Rust ↔ Qt/QML bridge macros (`#[cxx_qt::bridge]`, `#[qml_element]`, etc.) |
| `cxx-qt-lib` | 0.9.1 (`qt_gui`, `qt_qml` features) | Qt type bindings (`QString`, `QGuiApplication`, `QQmlApplicationEngine`, …) |
| `x11rb` | 0.13 | Raw X11 protocol access, used only by `x11strut.rs` for EWMH struts |
| `cxx-qt-build` | 0.9.1 (build-dependency) | Generates the Qt/QML build glue from `build.rs` |

You'll also need, at the system level:
- **Qt6** (Core, Gui, Qml, Quick, Quick Controls, Network) and its QML modules, including `Qt5Compat.GraphicalEffects` (used for icon color overlays) and `QtQuick.Window`
- A working C++ toolchain (cxx-qt compiles a C++ shim under the hood)
- pkg-config / qmake discoverable on your system so `cxx-qt-build` can locate Qt

---

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

`build.rs` will invoke `cxx-qt-build`, which compiles the Rust bridge files, generates the C++ glue, and bundles the two `.qrc` resource files (`qml.qrc`, `assets.qrc`) into the binary. There is no separate "install icons/fonts" step — everything referenced by the `.qrc` files is embedded directly into the executable at build time.

## Design System (AlthynUI)

Consistent across the status bar, start menu, and calendar:

- **Zinc palette**:
  - `zinc-950 @ ~80% opacity` — status bar background
  - `zinc-900` (`#18181b`) — popup window backgrounds
  - `zinc-800` (`#27272a`) — surfaces, top bars, pills
  - `zinc-700` (`#3f3f46`) — borders, hover states
  - `zinc-100` (`#f4f4f5`) — primary text
  - `zinc-400` (`#a1a1aa`) — muted/secondary text
- **White as the sole accent color**, with near-black text/icons drawn on top of it (selected nav pill, etc.)
- **No blur, no glass effects, no gradients** anywhere in the UI chrome
- Large popups (start menu, calendar) use generous corner radii; the bottom category nav is a pill shape
- Icons are recolored via `ColorOverlay` (from `Qt5Compat.GraphicalEffects`) rather than baked-in colors, so the same SVG can be tinted per-context (e.g. white-on-accent vs. zinc-100 default)
- Font family used throughout: **Inter** (`font.family: "Inter"`) — relies on the font being installed system-wide; it is *not* currently bundled/loaded via `FontLoader` inside the app itself

---

## Icons

All icons live under `src/qml/assets/icons/`, registered in `assets.qrc`, and are compiled straight into the binary — nothing is loaded from disk at runtime.

- Most icons are a **flat, Lucide-sourced set** (e.g. `settings.svg`, `star.svg`, `wifi-high.svg`, `battery-full.svg`)
- A handful of **legacy grouped subfolders** remain because they don't have a matching flat/Lucide-named file yet:
  - `arrows/` — `arrowleft.svg`, `arrowright.svg`, `arrowdown.svg`
  - `battery/` — older grouped battery icon variants (kept alongside the flat ones; not currently referenced by any QML)
  - `notification/` — `bell.svg`, `bell-dot.svg`
  - `volume/` — older grouped volume icon variants (kept alongside the flat ones; not currently referenced by any QML)
  - `wifi/` — older grouped wifi icon variants using numeric names (`four.svg`, `three.svg`, …; not currently referenced by any QML)
- `unknown.svg` is the fallback icon used by `AppIcon.qml` and `GridIcon.qml` when an app has no resolvable icon

If you add a new icon that duplicates an existing flat one by filename, the newer file will simply overwrite the old one on disk — there's no automatic conflict resolution beyond "last one copied wins."
